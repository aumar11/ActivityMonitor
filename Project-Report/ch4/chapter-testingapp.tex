Ensuring the databsses were synched correctly was another major task. At this stage activity clips were recorded and had a duration of approximatey 2-30 seconds. The results of the database contiously synced for 10 minutes intervals are shown in the table below. 10 minutes were chosen to see approxiamtely how many record were stored the results are shown below.

The data received accelerometer has been thourghly tested to ensure the output was calibrated as expected.

The orientation of the phone and therefore of the expected output of the accelerometer can be shown below. 12 point figure to be in serted!!!!! The expected and acual results of the 12 point test can be seen in the table below.
