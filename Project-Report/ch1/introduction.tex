The aim of this project is to develop a mobile phone app that will detect when a user changes from a sedentary (sitting) state to an active state and vice versa. An active state is defined as the user being in any other state other than a sedentary one i.e. standing, walking, and lying down. The users activity will be calculated and monitored based on these state transitions.
