The entry point is template.tex, settings are kept in the preamble file preamble.tex, references in references.tex, and chapters, appendices, figures, and all front matter are stored in separate subdirectories for neatness.

Usage: save template.tex and run make in a terminal where the pwd is report-writing. Use make clobber to remove generated files.

Note: use BibDesk to manage .bib files.
